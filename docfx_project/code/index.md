# Oh, so you actually are interested in the code reference, huh?

Well here you go sir (or ma'm). 

You'll find that every single `public` member of this code is documented... because while this is grade-a, clean, industry standard code (j.k. it's probably just above average), it still needs documentation for posterity.

> I've enabled the **TreatWarningsAsErrors** flag solution wide just to show how serious I am about this shit. No... Fucking... Warnings... DOCUMENT YOUR DAMN CODE.

Anyways, use the search bar now. 

Off you go. 

DO IT!
