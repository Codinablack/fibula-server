# OpenTibiaCore
#### A NetCore OpenTibia (7.71) server to rule them all?

### Why Tibia 7.71?
There was an infamous CipSoft hack in which all assets required to run the game at the time were leaked to the public. So, this is as real as it gets. 

Also, I kind of happen to hate aimbots and hotkeys- which were introduced on version 8 of the game.

### Why NetCore/C#?
Because it is **awesome**. It is fast, simple and way more maintainable than C++. It's also what half the industry uses and, well, I happen to be part of that half of the industry. And since it's mainly just me as the madman behind condig this, I get to f-ing *PICK* yo.
